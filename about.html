    <h4>Hi! I'm Matt and I'm the software craftsman...</h4>
    <blockquote>
        I believe that working code is not enough. The code must be better than just working and I like to call that kind of code - elegant. Elegant code is a perfection within deadlines delivered by pragmatic developer. I want to be a guy who is delivering elegant code.
